module Possibly exposing (Possibly(..))

{-| In short:

  - `Never` marks states as impossible

        empty : Is Possibly Empty filling_

  - [`Possibly`](https://dark.elm.dmy.fr/packages/lue-bird/elm-allowable-states/latest/Possibly) marks states as possible

        top : Is Never Empty (StackFilled element) -> element

#### in type declarations

    type alias Model =
        WithoutConstructorFunction
            { selected : Is Possibly Empty
            , planets : Stack Possibly Empty Planet
            , searchKeyWords : Stack Never Empty String
            }

    type alias WithoutConstructorFunction record =
        record

where `WithoutConstructorFunction` stops the compiler from creating a positional constructor function for `Model`.
