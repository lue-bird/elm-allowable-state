module Possibly exposing (Possibly(..))

{-| In short:

  - `Never` marks states as impossible

        top : Empty Never (StackFilled element) -> element

  - [`Possibly`](#Possibly) marks states as possible

        empty : Empty Possibly filling_

  - â†’ you can carry over non-emptiness-information

        import Fillable exposing (Empty(..), toFillingOrIfEmpty)

        type FocusHole possiblyOrNever item
            = Item item
            | Hole possiblyOrNever

    fromMaybe : Maybe value -> Empty Possibly value

    fromList : List element -> Empty Possibly (StackFilled element)


#### in type declarations

    type alias Model =
        WithoutConstructorFunction
            { selected : Empty Possibly Choice
            , planets : Empty Possibly (StackFilled Planet)
            , searchKeyWords : Empty Never (StackFilled String)
            }

    type alias WithoutConstructorFunction record =
        record

where `WithoutConstructorFunction` stops the compiler from creating a positional constructor function for `Model`.
