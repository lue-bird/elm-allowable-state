module Possibly exposing (Possibly(..))

{-| In short:

  - `Never` marks states as impossible

        empty : Is Possibly Empty filling_

  - [`Possibly`](#Possibly) marks states as possible

        top : Is Never Empty (StackFilled element) -> element

#### in type declarations

    type alias Model =
        WithoutConstructorFunction
            { selected : Is Choice Possibly Empty
            , planets : Is (StackFilled Planet) Possibly Empty
            , searchKeyWords : Is (StackFilled String) Never Empty
            }

    type alias WithoutConstructorFunction record =
        record

where `WithoutConstructorFunction` stops the compiler from creating a positional constructor function for `Model`.
